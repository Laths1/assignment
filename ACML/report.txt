The system in [39] used 1696 High Power Field (HPF), i.e.,
area visible under the maximum magnification power of the
electron microscope, images at 40X magnification. Each
HPF had a size of 1539 9 1376 pixels. The training data
consisted of 1200 with only 749 labeled images. The
testing dataset considered the rest of images. Dataset
augmentation used cropping, rotation, and mirroring. It
started by cropping into 512 9 512 pixels from original
images then images were rescaled to 1024 9 1024. Rotation and mirroring were both applied to the original HPF
images to produce more training samples. Rotation was
applied with a step size of 45°.

Image Pre-Processing and Data Augmentation
Magnetic resonance images from the database were of different sizes and were provided in int16 format. These images represent the input layer of the network, so they were normalized and resized to 256 × 256 pixels. 122 In order to augment the dataset, we transformed each image in two ways. The first
transformation was image rotation by 90 degrees. The second transformation was flipping images vertically, this way, we augmented our dataset three times, resulting in 9192 images.
